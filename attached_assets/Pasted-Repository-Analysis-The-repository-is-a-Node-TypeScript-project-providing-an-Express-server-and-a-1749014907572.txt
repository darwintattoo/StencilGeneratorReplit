Repository Analysis

The repository is a Node/TypeScript project providing an Express server and a React client for generating tattoo stencils. There is an image-processing module (server/image-processing.ts) implementing histogram equalization and CLAHE using sharp. The repository also contains scripts, uploads, and configuration files.

Several files end without a trailing newline, and some script files (e.g., scripts/create-default-users.ts, scripts/readme.md) show shell prompt text when displayed due to missing newlines. Image-processing functions risk divide‑by‑zero errors, and there are no automated tests. Additionally, no README or license is present.

Issues & Proposed Fixes
Trailing newline missing in many TypeScript files

Files such as server/routes.ts, server/routes/queue.ts, server/image-processing.ts, server/comfy.ts, and server/security.ts end without a newline, which causes prompt artifacts when viewed with cat and can lead to tooling warnings.

Potential divide‑by‑zero in histogram equalization

applyHistogramEqualization normalizes the CDF with totalPixels - cdfMin as a divisor, which can be zero if all pixels share the same luminance. Similar logic occurs in processTileWithCLAHE.

Repository lacks automated tests

Image-processing functions and API routes have no tests. Introducing basic tests would improve reliability.

Tarea sugerida
Add Jest tests for image-processing

Extraneous text/prompt when displaying script files

scripts/create-default-users.ts and scripts/readme.md show shell prompts when viewed because the final newline is missing.
